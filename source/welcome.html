              <p>Starting off as a Front-End Developer, I was able to build my skills to confidence in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, before taking my endeavors into the Back-End of development. After becoming a Full-Stack Developer, and qualifying for a couple of Google program scholarships, I have been able to work with many different private and public orgs like Parkland College, Willard Airport, and U of I, Pavlov Media, and UIC.
              </p>
              <p>I have a passion for community outreach and have been able to express it through multiple avenues. From teaching under-served high school students in the southside of Chicago, to being a TA at public universities and education programs. I have worked with non-profits to create free websites, applications, and make strategic business campaigns.
