                As a developer and educator with a passion for community building, I strongly believe that every member of our society should have access to high-quality education and technology resources. Unfortunately, many communities in Chicago are underserved in terms of technology education and resources, which creates a significant disadvantage for individuals in these communities. Therefore, I am committed to reaching out to these communities and providing them with the support they need to succeed.

                By working with and becoming affiliated with local organizations and other organizations larger in scope to create technology education programs that are accessible to individuals in underserved areas. This has involved providing workshops and training sessions that cover topics such as web development, coding, and digital literacy through the TechCorps Student Web Corps Program and the Google Next Code Pilot Program. Additionally, I aspire to identify and provide resources such as computers and internet access to individuals who may not have access to these resources. By doing so, I hope to empower individuals and youth in underserved communities and provide them with the tools they need to succeed in the digital age.

              <!-- <p>Starting off as a Front-End Developer, I was able to build my skills to confidence in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, before taking my endeavors into the Back-End of development. After becoming a Full-Stack Developer, and qualifying for a couple of Google program scholarships, I have been able to work with many different private and public orgs like Parkland College, Willard Airport, and U of I, Pavlov Media, and UIC.

              <p>I have a passion for community outreach and have been able to express it through multiple avenues. From teaching under-served high school students in the southside of Chicago, to being a TA at public universities and education programs. I have worked with non-profits to create free websites, applications, and make strategic business campaigns.
